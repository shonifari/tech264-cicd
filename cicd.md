# CICD

## What is CI? Benefits?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository. Automated builds and tests are run to ensure that the new code integrates well with the existing codebase.

### Benefits of CI

- **Early Detection of Errors**: Automated testing helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Frequent code integration encourages collaboration among team members.
- **Faster Development**: Continuous integration speeds up the development process by reducing integration issues.
- **Higher Code Quality**: Regular testing and integration improve the overall quality of the code.

## What is CD? Benefits?

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is an extension of CI that automates the deployment of code changes to production. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production.

### Benefits of CD

- **Faster Time to Market**: Automating the deployment process allows for quicker releases.
- **Reduced Manual Errors**: Automation reduces the risk of human errors during deployment.
- **Consistent Releases**: Ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable.
- **Improved Feedback Loop**: Faster deployments provide quicker feedback from users.

## Difference between CD and CDE

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automates the deployment of every change that passes the tests to production.
- **Continuous Delivery (CDE)**: Ensures that every change is deployable at any time but requires manual approval for deployment to production.
